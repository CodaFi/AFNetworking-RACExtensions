 * and returns an unusable subject and starts the operation.
 * Sample usage:
 *
 * [[[AFHTTPRequestOperation alloc]init]rac_start]subscribeCompleted:^{
 *    //Request Finished
 * }];
 *
 * Alternatively:
 *
 * [[[[AFHTTPRequestOperation alloc]init]rac_start]subscribeNext:(RACTuple *results)^{

 * A convience for AFImageRequestOperation's +imageRequestOperationWithRequest:success:.

 * and the response object in the second.  
 *
 * If you would like to simulate the image block present in the class, -map the returned tuple and
 * process the image like so:
 *
 * [[[AFImageRequestOperation rac_startImageRequestOperationWithRequest:imageRequest
 * ]map:^id(RACTuple *value) {
 *    UIImage *img = [value first];
 *    //Process the image
 *    return img;
 * }]subscribeNext:^(UIImage *image) {
 *    //Do some stuff with the newly processed image.
 * }];
 *
 * To keep image processing off the main thread, call -deliverOn: before -map'ing the sent value.
